PONG Inspired Simple Game

Made this game from scratch using OpenGL and GLFW.

It runs 800x800 by default. Left player controls are up/down arrows and right player controls are via mouse.
Once a player reaches 10 points, the game automatically resets.

For the score numbers, I used the Bit 5x3 font here: https://www.mattlag.com/bitfonts/
